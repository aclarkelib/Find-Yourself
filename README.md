# Find-Yourself Entry
For my entry I have built an application which allows you to scramble images using 
words. You can also descramble your scrambled images.

# Use
To scramble the image simply click on the "Scramble Image" button on the main menu.
Then type in your desired word and press the green "Scramble Image" button or press
the enter key.

To descramble an image click on the "Descramble Image" button on the main menu.
Then select an image from the numbers in the top left corner. Guess the word that
was used to scramble the image and then ress the green "Scramble Image" button or 
press the enter key to try to descramble the image.
